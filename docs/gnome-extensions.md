# GNOME Extensions

Run the following to install GNOME Extensions

```
sudo dnf install gnome-extensions-app -y
```

Run `gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-extension-version-validation true` so incompatible extensions will run with the current GNOME version.

Choose (light- or dark-top-bar) settings if you want to keep the top bar visible. Choose `(invisible-top-bar)` if you want to hide the top bar.

Change the following settings for the Built-In extensions:

- Background Logo: Off
- (light- or dark-top-bar) Pomodoro: On
